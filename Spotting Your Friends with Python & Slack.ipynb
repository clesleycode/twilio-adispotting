    "## Spotting Your Friends with Python & Slack \n",
    "\n",
    "One of my all-time favorite Facebook groups is \"DogSpotting.\" For those of you unfamiliar with this revolutionary group, it's a facebook group dedicated to posting pictures of random dogs you see as you go along your regular day. There are tons of \"spotting\" rules, but either way you slice it, this group is *awesome*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this model for inspiration, I built a slack bot for a college student group I was involved in once upon a time. We named it *ADI Spotting* and dedicated an entire slack channel to posting \"spottings\" of whenever we'd see eachother on campus, outside of our own events and meetings. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment Setup \n",
    "\n",
    "But before we even get started, we have to set our environment up. This guide was written in Python 3.6. If you haven't already, download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). Next, you’ll need to install several packages that we’ll use throughout this tutorial on the command line in our project directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip3 install slackclient==1.1.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/slack-apps), so click the \"Create a Slack App\" button as shown below: \n",
    "\n",
    "![ alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "sure to generate your API keys. Since we’ll be working with Python throughout, using the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) is the best way to get the most out of this tutorial. Once you have your notebook up and running, you can download all the data for this post from [GitHub](https://github.com/adicu/devfest-data-science). Make sure you have the data in the same directory as your notebook and then we’re good to go! \n",

    "## A Quick Note on Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "For those of you who are unfamiliar with Jupyter notebooks, I’ve provided a brief review of which functions will be particularly useful to move along with this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image below, you’ll see three buttons labeled 1-3 that will be important for you to get a grasp of -- the save button (1), add cell button (2), and run cell button (3). \n",
    "\n",
    "![ alt text](https://www.twilio.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/qwigKpOsph32AcwRNBGAPyPf885eso4nSOungzHEaJ5cZceEH6R9AwN9ZQi1UX2K4DWK2NvvQYA5napOIz-pcfg6YzdCqSNGQUPv9bR1poJ6Pd3nUrToZ1DP3wRHZhiE_DbFbLsz.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first button is the button you’ll use to **save your work** as you go along (1). Feel free to choose when to save your work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have the **“add cell”** button (2). Cells are blocks of code that you can run together. These are the building blocks of jupyter notebook because it provides the option of running code incrementally without having to to run all your code at once.  Throughout this tutorial, you’ll see lines of code blocked off -- each one should correspond to a cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, there’s the **“run cell”** button (3). Jupyter Notebook doesn’t automatically run it your code for you; you have to tell it when by clicking this button. As with add button, once you’ve written each block of code in this tutorial onto your cell, you should then run it to see the output (if any). If any output is expected, note that it will also be shown in this tutorial so you know what to expect. _Make sure to run your code as you go along because many blocks of code in this tutorial rely on previous cells._"
